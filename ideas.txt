Excellent! It sounds like the Delivery Partner pages (`/deliveries/my` and `/deliveries/map` placeholders) and the other core sections are now loading correctly after those fixes.

We've built a really strong base. Now, we can start adding more depth and completing the workflows. Based on our progress and your goals, here are the most logical next steps:

1.  **Stock Management (Crucial):** This is the most important missing piece for a warehouse/inventory system. We need to:
    * **Implement Stock Checks:** Prevent creating/confirming/shipping orders if there isn't enough stock in the assigned warehouse.
    * **Implement Stock Deduction:** Automatically decrease the `Item.quantity` when an order is marked as 'shipped' (either via the batch pickup or an admin/owner status update).
    * **Implement Stock Restoration:** Automatically increase `Item.quantity` if a confirmed/shipped order is 'cancelled'.
    * **(Later):** Add ways to manually adjust stock or record incoming inventory.

2.  **Implement Order Status Updates:** Activate the "Update Status" form on the Order Details page by creating the `PUT /orders/:id/status` route in `routes/orders.js`. This route needs the state machine logic (checking valid transitions) and will also tie into the stock management (point 1).

3.  **Implement Order Editing:** Activate the "Edit Order Items" button by creating the `PUT /orders/:id` route in `routes/orders.js`. This is complex as it requires comparing old/new items and calculating stock adjustments carefully.

4.  **Complete User CRUD:** Implement the `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes in `routes/users.js` to fully enable adding, updating, and deleting users.

5.  **Complete Warehouse/Store/Item CRUD:** Add the Edit, Update, and Delete functionality for these resources.

6.  **Implement Route Optimization:** Revisit `GET /deliveries/map` to make the Google Directions API call work correctly (ensure the API key in `.env` is correct and enabled for Directions API) and display the optimized route polyline on the map.

**Recommendation:**

I strongly recommend focusing on **#1 (Stock Management)** and **#2 (Order Status Updates)** next. They are tightly linked and fundamental to the application's purpose. We can implement the `PUT /orders/:id/status` route first, including the necessary stock checks and adjustments within it.

Would you like to proceed with implementing the **Order Status Update route (`PUT /orders/:id/status`)** including the crucial **stock deduction/restoration logic**?
